# Daily Planner

This is a simple daily planner web application that allows users to plan out their day from 9am to 5pm. Users can enter text into the text area for each hour block, and the application will save the text to local storage so that it persists even if the user refreshes the page.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- dayjs

## Features

- Users can enter and save text for each hour block
- Text is saved to local storage for persistence
- Hour blocks are color-coded based on whether they are in the past, present, or future
- Clear button allows users to clear all saved data from local storage

## Usage
